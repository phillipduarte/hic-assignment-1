I used ChatGPT to help set up my index.html file with the necessary sections I needed. 
I also used it along with copilot to help with CSS styling like which attributes I can use
to achieve certain goals. I also used this website to figure out how to use grid layouts
https://grid.layoutit.com/. I used this link: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_animate_buttons.asp
for help with animating the location button at the bottom. Copilot also helped write a lot of the javascript
code, especially helping me get started with using the openweathermap api, since I've never used
API calls in JS, (only Python).
